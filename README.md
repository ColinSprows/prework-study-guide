# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide created for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. I built this project to showcase what I have learned in the prework for the course. I am solving the problem of organizing useful information that I will be learning in one well organized place. I learned about basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
